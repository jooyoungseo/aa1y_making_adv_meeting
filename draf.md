# Pre-Survey Key Points
- Diverse participants with varying coding experiences
- Names and backgrounds:
  - Imran: Sophomore, Male, Low-Vision, Asian
  - Lila: 11th Grade, Female, blind, Caucasian
  - Isaac: 11th Grade, Male, blind, Caucasian
- Prior coding experience: Some had prior experience (e.g., Imran), others did not (e.g., Lila, Isaac)

---

# Post-Survey Key Points
- Focus on overall experience, skill development, and confidence
- Varied responses indicating growth in confidence and skills
- Enhanced interest in STEM fields post-program

---

# Comparative Analysis
- Transition from uncertainty or lack of experience to increased confidence
- Growth in confidence and skills among participants
- Enhanced interest in STEM careers and studies

---

# Specific Participant Insights
- Imran: Showed enhancement of prior coding experience

# Questions

1. How can we effectively transfer prior knowledge learned from CodeJumper and Snap Circuits to integrated prototyping with Snapino?

---

# Questions

2. We are using a swell form machine and Wikki Stix to create tactile materials that illustrate the concept of circuitry. Are there any other great scaffolding, tangible materials that we can employ for teaching circuitry and coding algorithms?

# Questions

3. In the face of growing AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), what do you envision for the future of coding education for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) teens?

---

# Questions

4. We are considering the use of AI-assisted coding tools, such as Copilot, in our Snapino lessons to help BVI learners focus on the logical process rather than being overwhelmed by programming syntax. What are your thoughts on this approach? What considerations do you think we need to take into account?
